# gbtlite
## Visualize metagenomes in a web browser

View coverage-GC plots of metagenome assemblies in your web browser with `gbtlite`. These plots are useful in quality control of metagenomic data, and in guiding the binning of individual genomes from metagenomes.

`gbtlite` implements these visualizations using the [D3.js library](http://d3js.org). 

See the live demo here: 

If you find this useful, consider trying the full [`gbtools` package for R](https://github.com/kbseah/genome-bin-tools), which allows selection and manipulation of bins, in addition to visualization.

## Instructions

Prepare your data for plotting. You need to have a metagenome assembly and the raw reads used to make that assembly. Calculate the coverage statistics for the assembly by mapping the reads to the assembly with bbmap.sh.

The input, like for `gbtools`, is the "covstats" output from bbmap.sh, which contains the coverage statistics for each contig in an assembly. You'll have to manually (sorry) remove the `#` character from the header line of the file before feeding it to `gbtlite`.

Refer to the `gbtools` manual for [instructions and example commands](https://github.com/kbseah/genome-bin-tools/wiki/1.-Produce-and-annotate-metagenomic-assembly) (only step 1a is necessary for `gbtlite`).
